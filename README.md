# PRODIGY_DS_04
Analyse and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to  understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands 

# ABOUT_THE_DATA
The twitter_training.csv dataset contains 74,682 rows of social media comments related to video games.
The data is structured into four columns:(id, game_name, sentiment, and tweet_content).
The tweet_content column, which contains the text of the tweets, has some missing values.
The game_name and sentiment columns are categorical, and the sentiment column is likely the target variable for a classification model.

# CONCLUSION
The project successfully identified patterns in social media 
sentiments. 
Businesses can leverage these insights to: 
* Improve customer engagement. 
* Address negative feedback proactively. 
* Track changes in brand perception over time.
